## Overview

**Coding Beyond Borders and Bugs** is a blog website designed to introduce visitors to the stimulating world of tech storytelling. The site includes:
- A **Homepage** that welcomes users with a hero image, an introduction to our tech adventures, and a call-to-action button directing readers to the **Story** page.
- A **Story Page** featuring a rich narrative and navigation buttons (e.g., "Back to Home" and "Sign Up") for a seamless user experience.
- (Optional) A **Sign Up/Contact** page referenced via the navigation bar for users who want to join our community.

Interactivity is a core component of the project. Visitors can customize the header subtitle and background color (with animations), interact with an image gallery that cycles through images on click, and (if implemented) enjoy real-time form validation on the sign-up page.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:**  
  - Developed with a mobile-first approach using HTML5 and CSS3.
  - Utilizes media queries to ensure a smooth experience on any device.

- **Interactive Elements:**  
  - Dynamic header controls (change subtitle and background color with animations).
  - Interactive hero image gallery with animated transitions.
  - Keyboard interactions and double-click actions for added fun and user engagement.

- **Multipage Navigation:**  
  - Consistent navigation menus across pages (Home, Story, and Sign Up) ensure a cohesive browsing experience.

- **Persistent User Preferences:**  
  - Uses Local Storage to maintain header customizations (e.g., subtitle and background color) across sessions.

- **Form Validation:**  
  - (If the Sign Up page is implemented) Real-time feedback helps users create accounts with valid information.
